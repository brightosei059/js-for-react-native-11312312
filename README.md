## MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT

 ## Description
 
Create a JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js.
Implement a function called processArray that takes an array of numbers as an argument.
The function should return a new array where each even number is squared, and each odd number is tripled.
formatArrayStrings Function:
In arrayManipulation.js, add a function called formatArrayStrings.
This function takes two arrays:
An array of strings.
An array of numbers processed by the processArray function.
Modify each string based on its corresponding number:
Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.


## Features and Functionality

Array Manipulation:
The processArray function processes an input array of numbers.
Even numbers are squared (e.g., 4 becomes 16).
Odd numbers are tripled (e.g., 3 becomes 9).
String Formatting:
The formatArrayStrings function modifies strings based on the processed numbers.
If the number is even, the entire string is capitalized.
If the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.
User Profiles:
The createUserProfiles function generates user profiles.
It combines original names with modified names.
Each profile includes an auto-incremented ID.
